    <p>
    As a company based in the UAE, Dubai, SCREW LTD. is committed to providing users with quality applications and games that are safe and secure. <br>To ensure that our distribution process is efficient and fair, we have established the following policy:
    <br><br>
    1. <b>Application and Game Submission Process:</b> All developers who wish to submit their applications or games to SCREW LTD. for distribution must go through a submission process. This process includes providing information about the app/game, its functionality, and its compatibility with various devices.
    <br>
    2. <b>Review Process:</b> After the submission, SCREW LTD. will conduct a review of the application/game to ensure that it meets the company's standards. This review will be based on the app/game's functionality, quality, and user experience.
    <br>
    3. <b>Distribution:</b> If an application or game is approved, it will be distributed through SCREW LTD.'s platform, and the developer will be notified. SCREW LTD. will take a 30% share of the income generated by the application/game, and the remaining 70% will be paid to the developer.
    <br>
    4. <b>User Protection:</b> SCREW LTD. is committed to protecting users from malicious or harmful applications and games. To ensure this, we will conduct regular security checks on all applications/games distributed through our platform.
    <br>
    5. <b>Updates:</b> Developers can submit updates to their applications/games at any time. SCREW LTD. will review these updates to ensure that they meet the company's standards before distributing them to users.
    <br>
    6. <b>Dispute Resolution:</b> Any disputes or disagreements between developers and SCREW LTD. regarding application/game distribution will be resolved through a formal process.
    <br>
    7. <b>Policy Changes:</b> SCREW LTD. reserves the right to change this policy at any time. If changes are made, developers will be notified in advance.
    <br><br>
    By following this policy, SCREW LTD. hopes to provide users with high-quality applications and games while ensuring that developers are fairly compensated for their work.
